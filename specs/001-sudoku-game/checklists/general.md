# Requirements-Quality Checklist: Modern Sudoku Game Website

**Purpose**: Lightweight self-check to validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of the feature requirements
**Created**: 2026-01-23
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all difficulty options defined with explicit ranges and names that match across the spec? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-005a]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all core interactions (new game, cell selection, number entry, undo, erase, pencil) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-009, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK003 Are all visual feedback behaviors (active cell, row/column/box highlight, completion animation, win modal) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-016, Spec §FR-017, Spec §FR-018]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the dynamic footer year requirement explicitly defined for future years? [Completeness, Spec §FR-021]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is “sleek, modern” appearance clarified with measurable or observable criteria (layout, typography, spacing, color intent)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001, Ambiguity]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the “domino-style” completion animation described with enough detail to avoid multiple interpretations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-017]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the rule for “incorrect” entries unambiguous and aligned with the clarifications section? [Clarity, Spec §FR-013, Spec §Clarifications]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do the user scenarios and functional requirements describe the same input modes and constraints? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-010a, Spec §FR-010b]
- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria consistent with the functional requirements for puzzle generation and uniqueness? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §SC-007]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic for the key user actions? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK011 Are acceptance scenarios defined for each priority user story and testable independently? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Stories]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Do requirements cover both normal and pencil modes for number entry across mouse/touch/keyboard? [Coverage, Spec §FR-010a, Spec §FR-010b, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK013 Are zero-state or first-load behaviors for “no active cell” and “no prior actions” defined? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are edge cases for undo/erase behavior and editing of pre-filled cells fully specified (including expected UI feedback)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-015]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are mobile responsiveness and performance targets explicitly captured as requirements, not just assumptions? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Assumptions]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK016 Are assumptions about “no persistence” and “static web app” explicitly reflected in the requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-001]
